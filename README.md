Web development evolves rapidly, with new package versions released daily. This fast pace can quickly render your project's dependencies outdated. Updating these dependencies is challenging and risky, especially for production projects with many users relying on them. New versions can introduce breaking changes, security vulnerabilities, or issues in the dependencies of your dependencies.

Enter **Sifu** or `Should I F***ing Update?`

Sifu is an application that provides insights into every version of a dependency, helping you make informed decisions about updating your project's dependencies. It offers detailed information and guidance, minimizing the risks and ensuring your project stays secure and up-to-date.

I suggest checking out [the link](https://sifuapp.vercel.app/dependencies/react?source=18.0.0&target=18.3.1) to the application page which compares React version `18.0.0` and `18.3.1`:
